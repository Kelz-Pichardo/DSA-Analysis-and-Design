In this course, I had to submit portions of each project to a GitHub repository as part of my portfolio. For Project One, I had to analyze the run-time and memory for different data structures. For Project Two, I had to write code that sorts and prints out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphabetical order. As part of the project, I also had to reflect on my work by answering a set of questions that help me cement my learning and add context to refresh my memory in the future.

In Project One, I was solving the problem of analyzing the run-time and memory performance of different data structures. I had to implement several data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary trees, and analyze their performance using Big-O notation. To approach this problem, I needed to have a good understanding of the different data structures, their operations, and their time and space complexity. Data structures are important because they provide a way to organize and manipulate data efficiently, which is crucial in many computer science applications.

In Project Two, I had to write code that sorts and prints out a list of the courses in the Computer Science program in alphabetical order. This involved implementing a sorting algorithm, such as bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, or mergesort, and using it to sort the list of courses in alphabetical order. To approach this problem, I needed to have a good understanding of sorting algorithms and their time complexity. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and is used in many applications, such as search engines, databases, and social networks.

During these projects, I encountered roadblocks, such as bugs in my code or difficulties in understanding certain concepts. To overcome these roadblocks, I consulted online resources, textbooks, or my peers or instructor for help. I also experimented with different solutions and debugged my code until it worked as expected. Overcoming roadblocks is an essential skill in software development, as it teaches you how to troubleshoot and find solutions to problems.

Working on these projects has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by giving me a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithms. I learned how to choose the appropriate data structure for a particular problem, how to analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms, and how to implement and optimize code for performance. These skills are essential for designing efficient and scalable software that can handle large amounts of data and complex operations.

In addition, my work on these projects has evolved the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I learned how to write clear and concise code that is easy to understand and modify. I also learned how to use best practices, such as commenting my code, using meaningful variable names, and writing modular and reusable code. Writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code is important because it makes it easier for me and others to modify, test, and debug code in the future.

Overall, working on these projects has given me a valuable set of skills and knowledge in data structures and algorithms, as well as software design and development. These skills are essential for a career in computer science or any other field that requires software development. By reflecting on my work and updating my portfolio, I can showcase my achievements and use them to advance my career or pursue further education in this field.
